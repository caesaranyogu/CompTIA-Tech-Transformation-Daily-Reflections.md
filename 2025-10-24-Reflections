What I learn

Transport layer concepts: initial window, TCP segment order, out-of-order packet handling, and congestion control.

Differences between stateless vs stateful firewalls, forward vs reverse proxies, and specialized firewalls (email, web, database).

Layer-specific devices: TAPs, port mirroring, and where they operate in the OSI model.

Forwarding and routing logic, and how switching works in networks.

Proxy inspection techniques, including hash-based blocking and deep packet inspection.

Real-world network examples: MAN vs CAN, and how a campus vs city network differ.

How DNA can be conceptualized as digital information (1s and 0s).

Firewall market share for major vendors: Palo Alto, Cisco, Fortinet, and Juniper.


Challenges faced

Understanding how transport layer protocols determine the initial TCP window without prior acknowledgements.

Conceptualizing how videos receive out-of-order packets yet play seamlessly.

Mapping firewall filtering across all OSI layers and understanding AI-driven or passive firewalls.

Distinguishing forward vs reverse proxies and their application-layer functions.

Remembering forward proxy vs reverse proxy for exam and real-world scenarios.

Distinguishing TAPs vs port mirroring, and mapping them to Layer 1 or Layer 2.

Understanding how proxies use hash tables for blocking and when that applies.

Remembering specialized firewalls: email, web (WAF), database, and their functions.

Understanding MAN vs CAN networks in real-world contexts like Athens, Georgia.

Converting biological sequences (DNA) into a digital/binary analogy.


How I solved them (Prompt-style questions)

Transport Layer Initial Window:
How does the TCP transport layer pick its initial window without receiving acknowledgements?

Resolved by explaining TCP’s slow start algorithm and use of default window sizes based on OS and connection type.

Out-of-order Video Packets:
Why do videos receive packets out of order but play smoothly?

Explained buffering, reordering, and TCP/UDP handling at transport layer.

Firewall Filtering at OSI Layers:
What does firewall filtering look like at each OSI layer?

Learned filtering examples for Layer 2 through Layer 7; included network, stateful, and application-layer inspection.

AI and Passive Firewalls:
Are there AI-driven firewalls and can firewalls operate in detect-only mode?

Clarified NGFWs can be passive or active; AI adds anomaly detection.

Proxy Functions as Application Firewalls:
Why can a proxy act as an application firewall?

Resolved: application proxies inspect Layer 7 traffic and enforce security policies, acting as WAFs.

Forward vs Reverse Proxy:
How do I remember forward vs reverse proxies?

Used mnemonics: “Forward → client protection; Reverse → server protection” with secret agent vs bodyguard analogy.

TAP vs Port Mirroring:
Is port mirroring the same as a TAP?

Resolved: TAP = Layer 1, passive; port mirroring = Layer 2, active copying of frames.

Proxies and Hash-based Blocking:
Do proxies turn block tables into hashes and block when they match?

Resolved: hashes are used for known files; combined with DPI, ML, and signature checks.

Specialized Firewalls:
What is an email firewall, WAF, and database firewall?

Explained their Layer 7 focus, use cases, and common vendors.

MAN vs CAN Networks:
How do MAN and CAN networks differ?

Resolved with real-world examples (UGA campus = CAN; Athens city fiber = MAN).

DNA as Digital Data:
How is DNA represented as 1s and 0s?

Explained base-4 to binary conversion, codons, and analogy to computer information systems.

Firewall Market Share:
Who has the biggest firewall market share: Juniper, Cisco, Fortinet, or Palo Alto?

Reviewed reports showing Palo Alto leading, followed by Cisco and Fortinet; Juniper smaller.

Stateless vs Stateful Firewalls:
Why are they called stateless and stateful?

Explained “state” = tracking connection info; stateless = per-packet decisions, stateful = keeps session context.
