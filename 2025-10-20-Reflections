Network+ Study Log ‚Äì DHCP, ARP, Multicast, and Anycast

üß† What I Learned

VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) allows efficient IP usage by subnetting networks into different sizes as needed.

DHCP operates in four stages: Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledge (DORA).

Setting an IP lease time too long can increase attack risk because stale IPs remain in use, giving attackers more time to spoof or hijack them.

DHCP Exclusions reserve specific IPs to prevent the DHCP server from assigning them ‚Äî useful for devices with static IPs like routers or printers.

DHCP Broadcasts can reveal your network presence, which is risky in covert or high-security operations.

You can manually release and renew DHCP leases using ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew.

Having two external DNS servers ensures redundancy and availability if one fails.

An IP starting with 169.254.x.x means the device failed to get a DHCP address and assigned itself an APIPA (Automatic Private IP Address).

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) starts with the IP address and asks the network for its matching MAC address.

Multicast addresses occupy the 224.0.0.0 ‚Äì 239.255.255.255 range (Class D) and allow one-to-many communication.

Anycast uses one IP address shared by multiple servers, and routers automatically direct traffic to the nearest instance.

In Windows, you can change network adapter settings through either Control Panel or the Settings app to modify IP, DNS, or DHCP behavior.


‚öîÔ∏è Challenges Faced

Understanding how DHCP actually assigns and reclaims IPs.

Confusion about why IP leases that are too long can create security vulnerabilities.

Distinguishing between DHCP exclusions and simply not assigning an IP.

Recognizing how DHCP broadcasts could expose network activity during covert operations.

Clarifying the meaning of 169.254.x.x addresses and how they relate to DHCP failures.

Remembering whether ARP begins with a MAC or an IP query.

Visualizing the difference between unicast, multicast, and anycast in real networks.

Learning the practical steps to change adapter settings or configure static IPs in Windows.


üß∞ How I Solved Them
1Ô∏è‚É£ How does DHCP assign and reclaim IPs?

I broke it down into the DORA process:

Discover: Client broadcasts for a DHCP server.

Offer: Server replies with an available IP.

Request: Client asks to use that IP.

Acknowledge: Server confirms and sets the lease.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Why can long DHCP leases be a risk?

I learned that long leases leave stale IPs active for longer periods ‚Äî attackers could impersonate offline devices and maintain unauthorized access undetected.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Why exclude an IP instead of not assigning it?

Exclusions explicitly protect certain IPs from being leased accidentally. This ensures manual/static devices always have reserved addresses.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Why are DHCP broadcasts risky in sensitive environments?

Broadcasts reveal that a network exists ‚Äî a red flag in stealth or recon missions. Disabling DHCP or switching to static IPs reduces this footprint.

5Ô∏è‚É£ What does a 169.254.x.x address mean?

That‚Äôs APIPA ‚Äî Windows assigns it automatically when no DHCP reply arrives, meaning no valid IP was leased.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Does ARP start with IP or MAC?

ARP starts with the IP address ‚Äî it asks, ‚ÄúWho has this IP?‚Äù to learn the matching MAC.

7Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the difference between multicast and anycast?

Multicast: One sender ‚Üí multiple receivers (group subscription).

Anycast: One IP shared ‚Üí nearest server responds (location-based routing).

8Ô∏è‚É£ How do I change adapter settings on Windows?

Through Control Panel ‚Üí Network and Sharing Center ‚Üí Change adapter settings, or through Settings ‚Üí Network & Internet ‚Üí Ethernet/Wi-Fi ‚Üí Edit IP settings.
