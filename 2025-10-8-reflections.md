What I Learned:
Defined the different Network Topologies, their advantages and disadvantages. I have an understanding of how networks can be arranged and why.
Learned what the different OSI model layers are composed of and their functions in the data transfer process. I can explain now better remember more processes of the data transfer process by connecting them to the OSI model.
I completed a SOHO router setup simulation on CompTIAs Network+ Lab. I now understand how the cables connect the SOHO router to the desktop computer.
Better understood troubleshooting by practicing scenario based questions and identifying steps of the process taken and are next.

Challenges Faced:
Fatigue started to settle in and concepts began to become harder to understand

How I Solved Them:
Researched ways to stay alert. Top things that worked for me: Sunlight and working on assignments aoutside/ changing environments. Physical exercise and movement. 20 minute micronap.

Next Steps:
Continue my readings on Ethernet, wiring, connectors, fiber optics, and cable troubleshooting.
Complete Cisco Router exercises on Cisco skills for all and integrate/apply learned information to OT/ICS cybersecurity like activities in my home lab
