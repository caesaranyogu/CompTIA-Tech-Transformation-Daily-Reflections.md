What I Learned
Attenuation, Crosstalk, Fiber Optics and Becoming More Specific About My ICS Field.
Wavelength Division Multiplexing is the process of sending more than one frequency through a wire to improve data transfer.
Completed simulation labs on configuring ethernet and fiber optic cables in a virtual network room to troubleshoot connectivity issues via CompTIA labs. Used ping to verify connectivity.
Talk to Dragos DFIR team member about focusing in on a field. Realized I would like something best along the lines of blue team prevention and investigation.

What I Had Trouble With
Understanding crosstalk and attenuation measurements/ratios

How I Solved This
Used AI to explain these concepts with analogies

Next Steps
Make mental matrix of crosstalk and attenuation measurememts.
Find my desired ICS role and remap my certificate pathway
