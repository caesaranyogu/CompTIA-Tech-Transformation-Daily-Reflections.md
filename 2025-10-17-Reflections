IP Addresses


What I Learned

How non-default subnet masks (like /28) affect valid host ranges and subnet boundaries.

How incorrect subnet masks can cause hosts to misroute traffic or unnecessarily involve the default gateway.

The difference between ARP (maps IP to MAC) and MAC address tables (map MACs to switch ports).

The meaning of a 169.254.x.x (APIPA) address and how it indicates DHCP failure.

How a host on a remote network resolves addresses by finding the MAC of the default gateway through ARP.

How hubs and bridges handle broadcast traffic by flooding it to all ports except the source.

How a subnet mask that’s too broad makes a host believe remote IPs are local, leading to selective communication issues.

How IPv6 link-local addresses are automatically assigned, enabling devices to communicate locally without manual configuration.

The structure and purpose of IPv6 global unicast addresses (starting with 001).

How to design efficient subnetting using VLSM to minimize IP address waste (e.g., /26, /27, /28 based on host requirements).


Challenges Faced

Understanding how subnet masks change network boundaries when prefixes aren’t /8, /16, or /24.

Diagnosing why incorrect subnet masks cause routing detours or communication failures.

Clarifying which protocol or table handles MAC-to-IP vs. MAC-to-port mapping.

Recognizing APIPA addresses and their relation to DHCP failures.

Distinguishing between IPv6 link-local and global unicast scopes.

Learning how legacy network devices handle broadcast flooding.

Troubleshooting selective connectivity caused by broad subnet masks.

Applying VLSM properly to real-world subnetting needs.


How I Solved Them 

Q1: How can I identify which hosts belong to the same subnet when using non-default masks like /28?
A1: Convert IPs to binary and compare the network bits. This reveals the true subnet boundary.

Q2: What happens when a host’s subnet mask is incorrect?
A2: A too-long mask sends replies through the router unnecessarily; a too-short mask makes the host think remote devices are local.

Q3: Which protocol maps IPs to MACs, and which matches MACs to switch ports?
A3: ARP maps IP → MAC, while switches maintain MAC address tables to map MAC → port.

Q4: Why would a Windows host have a 169.254.x.x address?
A4: The DHCP server didn’t respond, so Windows assigned itself an APIPA address to communicate only within the local link.

Q5: How does a host find the MAC address of a remote destination?
A5: It finds the MAC of the default gateway using the ARP cache, since the gateway handles inter-network routing.

Q6: How do hubs and bridges handle broadcast traffic?
A6: They flood broadcasts out of all ports except the one the frame came in on.

Q7: What happens if a host’s subnet mask is too broad?
A7: The host believes more addresses are local, skips the gateway, and fails to reach remote devices correctly.

Q8: What feature lets IPv6 devices communicate locally without setup?
A8: Automatic link-local address assignment (starting with fe80::).

Q9: How do you minimize IP waste using VLSM?
A9: Assign subnet sizes based on host needs — /26 for 60 hosts, /27 for 30 hosts, /28 for 14 hosts — starting from the largest subnet.
