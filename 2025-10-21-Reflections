🧠 What Did I Learn

In this session, I deepened my understanding of core networking and troubleshooting concepts from the CompTIA Network+ curriculum. I learned:

The purpose of the Firewall Diagnostics: States page and how it tracks live connection sessions.

The difference between firmware and software, and how firmware acts as the “brainstem” of hardware.

That firmware can be upgraded—like performing careful brain surgery on a device’s memory.

The role of ICMP in network communication and diagnostics (e.g., ping and traceroute).

The pros and cons of direct vs indirect routing.

The difference between router metrics like bandwidth, traffic, and reliability.

The conceptual and operational differences between distance-vector and link-state routing protocols.

How OSPF functions as a link-state protocol that builds a complete map of the network for efficient path selection.

The full CompTIA troubleshooting methodology, emphasizing identifying causes, forming theories, testing, implementing, verifying, and documenting.

What cache poisoning is and how it tricks DNS caches to redirect users to fake or malicious sites.

⚙️ Challenges Faced

Understanding the Firewall Diagnostics page in plain terms — the table layout and what each column represents felt abstract at first.

Differentiating firmware vs software, especially in terms of function and upgradability.

Visualizing ICMP and how it differs from other protocols (since it doesn’t carry user data).

Getting clear on routing terms like direct/indirect and how router metrics (bandwidth, traffic, reliability) affect path decisions.

Remembering how distance vector and link state protocols actually choose routes differently.

Making sense of OSPF’s map-building without technical jargon.

Memorizing and internalizing the order and logic of the CompTIA troubleshooting methodology.

Understanding cache poisoning not just as a definition, but as a real-world attack scenario.

🧩 How I Solved Them

Here are the cleaned-up prompt-style questions that guided my problem-solving process:

How does the OPNsense “Firewall Diagnostics: States” page actually work in simple terms?
→ I reimagined it like a “traffic control tower,” where each row represents a flight (connection) being tracked in real time, showing its direction, protocol, and applied rule.

What’s the difference between firmware and software in everyday terms?
→ I compared firmware to a device’s brainstem (deep control, rarely changed) and software to the apps and thoughts that run on top of it.

Can firmware be changed or upgraded, and how risky is it?
→ I visualized it as brain surgery—possible, but delicate, requiring exact tools (manufacturer updates).

What is ICMP and why is it useful?
→ I saw it as the postal service’s “return to sender” system, sending short diagnostic notes between devices instead of full letters (data).

What are the pros and cons of direct vs indirect routing?
→ I used a travel analogy: direct routing is like taking a direct flight (faster, simpler), while indirect is like connecting flights (more flexible, handles complex networks).

What’s the difference between router metrics like bandwidth, traffic, and reliability?
→ I thought of it as choosing a road:

Bandwidth = road width,

Traffic = how crowded it is,

Reliability = how often it’s closed or broken.

What’s the difference between distance vector and link state routing?
→ I imagined two kinds of travelers:

Distance vector = follows directions from friends (hop counts).

Link state = studies the entire map and picks the best path independently.

How does OSPF work in simple language?
→ It’s like a GPS system—routers share their maps, build a full view of the network, and always choose the shortest route based on current conditions.

What’s the right order of steps in the CompTIA troubleshooting methodology, and why does it matter?
→ I learned it’s like detective work—you first collect clues, test theories, plan, fix, verify, and finally document so you can solve future cases faster.

What is cache poisoning and why is it dangerous?
→ I used a librarian analogy—someone tricks the librarian into remembering the wrong shelf for a book (DNS address), sending users to fake or malicious sites.
