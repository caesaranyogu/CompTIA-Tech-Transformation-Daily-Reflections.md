What Did I Learn

IEEE: The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) develops global networking standards like 802.1Q (for VLAN tagging).

VLAN Fundamentals: VLANs logically segment network traffic to improve efficiency and security without changing physical topology.

Access (Untagged) vs Trunk (Tagged) Ports:

Access/Untagged ports handle traffic for a single VLAN and send/receive frames without tags.

Trunk/Tagged ports can carry traffic from multiple VLANs and attach 802.1Q tags to frames to identify VLAN membership.

Voice VLAN (Auxiliary VLAN): Enables separation of voice and data traffic over the same physical connection, simplifying VoIP deployment.

Default and Native VLANs:

Default VLAN (VLAN 1) is assigned to all ports by default but should not carry user data.

Native VLAN is used for untagged traffic on trunk links and should be distinct from the default VLAN for security.

VoIP Configuration:

PCs connect to the phone, and the phone connects to the wall port.

The switch differentiates PC (untagged) and voice (tagged) traffic using access and voice VLAN commands.

Challenges Faced

Understanding how tagged and untagged ports differ in behavior and usage.

Clarifying how VoIP phones and PCs share the same physical connection without causing network conflicts.

Distinguishing between default VLAN and native VLAN and their security implications.

Remembering the correct configuration order when setting up a voice VLAN.

How I Solved Them (Cleaned Prompt Questions + Explanations)
1. ❓ What is the IEEE and why is it important for networking?

I learned that the IEEE sets and maintains the technical standards for how networking technologies interoperate, such as Ethernet (802.3) and VLAN tagging (802.1Q).

2. ❓ How do tagged and untagged ports handle VLAN traffic differently?

Tagged ports add VLAN tags to identify traffic from multiple VLANs (used on trunks), while untagged ports send traffic without tags and belong to a single VLAN (used for end devices).

Analogy: Tagged ports are like couriers labeling packages for different destinations; untagged ports handle only one destination.

3. ❓ How do VoIP phones and PCs share one wall port safely?

A VoIP handset has a built-in mini-switch with two ports — one connects to the wall (uplink), and one connects to the PC.

The PC traffic is untagged and assigned to the data VLAN.

The voice traffic is tagged and assigned to the voice VLAN.
This is configured on the switch using:
