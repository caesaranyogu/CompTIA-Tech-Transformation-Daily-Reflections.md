What I Learned:

* Protocol Evolution: Token Bus, CSMA/CD Ethernet, WDM and metaphorical hyperdimensional multiplexing.
* Hardware & Cabling: NICs hold protocol logic, Ethernet CAT3-CAT8 standards, fiber optics standards, slot vs port concepts, duplex modes.
* Frames & Traffic: TCP segmentation, jumbo and runt frames.
* PoE Standards: Alternative A/B, four-pair PoE, compatibility with devices and link speeds.
* Switch Troubleshooting: Power issues, hardware failures, MAC/CAM table usage, STP/RSTP to prevent loops, broadcast storms.
* Analogies: Collisions as multiple selves, slot/floor vs port/room, PoE lanes as roads for data and power.

Challenges Faced:

* Understanding the difference between running-config vs startup-config.
* Visualizing how MAC tables work with flooding and loops.
* Grasping duplex modes and which PoE pairings work with Gigabit Ethernet.
* Differentiating slots, ports, and subslots on modular devices.

How I Solved Them:

* Used analogies to relate network concepts to physical and spiritual metaphors.
* Visualized slot/port relationships as floors and rooms.
* Consulted MAC table behavior examples to understand frame flooding.
* Studied PoE pair usage and speeds with simple diagrams in mind.

Next Steps:

* Practice configuring network addressing, including IPs, subnets, and VLANs on switches.
* Apply troubleshooting workflow to simulated lab environments.
* Observe MAC table learning and flooding behavior in real devices or simulators.
