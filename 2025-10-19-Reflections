What I Learned

UDP = User Datagram Protocol, faster but unreliable, used for real-time applications.

ICMP = Internet Control Message Protocol, used for network status messages and diagnostics (e.g., ping).

Traceroute outputs number of hops, IP address of ingress interface, and round-trip time; this helps map the network path.

Traceroute timeout adjustments can indicate bandwidth issues.

Commands to view routing tables: ip route show (Linux), route print (Windows).

IPv6 handles fragmentation differently from IPv4: hosts must perform Path MTU Discovery.

Routing algorithms are categorized as Distance Vector or Link State, with some hybrid protocols.

RIB (Routing Information Base) stores learned routes from neighbors, static entries, and connected networks, not all possible paths.

Networks under a single administrative control are Autonomous Systems (AS); protocols are classified as IGPs (Interior Gateway Protocols) or EGPs (Exterior Gateway Protocols).

EIGRP operates directly over IP (protocol 88), uses hello messages, and multicasts updates.

TCP and UDP exist at the transport layer; EIGRP does not use them.

Distance Vector protocols rely on neighbors for network info; Link State protocols (like OSPF) build full network topology.

OSPF is hierarchical, supports areas, backbone (Area 0), ABRs, and ASBRs; uses LSAs, SPF algorithm, multicast, and protocol 89.

RIP selects routes based on the lowest hop count.

Link State vs Distance Vector: Link State stores full topology; Distance Vector relies on neighbor info.

BGP uses TCP (port 179).

When multiple routes exist within the same protocol, the route with the lowest metric is chosen.


Challenges Faced

Understanding what UDP and ICMP actually do and when they’re used.

Interpreting traceroute outputs (hops, ingress IP, time) and what changes in timeout indicate.

Identifying which command outputs the routing table across OSes.

Understanding IPv6 fragmentation differences from IPv4.

Grasping RIB functionality and whether routers store every possible path.

Distinguishing IGP vs EGP and AS concepts.

Comprehending EIGRP operation and why it doesn’t use TCP/UDP.

Differentiating Distance Vector vs Link State algorithms and their advantages/disadvantages.

Understanding OSPF hierarchical structure, areas, backbone, ABRs, ASBRs, LSAs, SPF algorithm.

Knowing how RIP selects routes.

Remembering BGP relies on TCP.

Determining how routers select routes when multiple options exist in the same protocol.


How I Solved Them

Asked: “What does UDP stand for?” → Learned definition, analogy, and use cases.

Asked: “What does ICMP mean?” → Learned it’s for network diagnostics, using analogy to ping.

Asked: “Explain traceroute output (hops, IP, time) in simple English.” → Broke down each field and used road trip analogy.

Asked: “Why does increasing traceroute timeout indicate a bandwidth issue?” → Learned the concept of slow links delaying packet responses.

Asked: “Which command outputs the active routing table?” → Identified ip route show as Linux-specific, clarified other OS differences.

Asked: “How does IPv6 handle fragmentation differently from IPv4?” → Learned that hosts handle it via Path MTU Discovery.

Asked: “Where does the RIB come from?” → Learned RIB comes from neighbors, static routes, and connected networks; does not store all paths.

Asked: “Explain IGP vs EGP and Autonomous System.” → Clarified the roles of OSPF, BGP, and AS numbers.

Asked: “Explain EIGRP operation, protocol number, hello messages, and multicasts.” → Learned it’s encapsulated in IP (protocol 88) and doesn’t use TCP/UDP.

Asked: “TCP and UDP: are they transport layer?” → Confirmed yes and explained with analogy.

Asked: “Explain distance vector vs link state, OSPF hierarchy, SPF, LSAs, and areas.” → Broke down network maps and routing database functions.

Asked: “In RIP, how is a route selected if it already exists?” → Learned the lowest metric is chosen.

Asked: “Principal difference between link state and distance vector protocols?” → Learned link state stores full topology; distance vector relies on neighbors.

Asked: “What protocol does BGP use?” → Learned it uses TCP (port 179).

Asked: “If two routes exist in the same protocol with same prefix length, how is one chosen?” → Learned the route with the lowest metric is used.


Next Steps

Study Firewalls: packet filtering, stateful vs stateless, and how firewall rules affect routing and security.
