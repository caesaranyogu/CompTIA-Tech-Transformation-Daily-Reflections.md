🧠 Network+ Study Log — October 11, 2025

What I Learned Today
Understood that Ethernet is both a physical cabling standard and a data link protocol.
Learned that each switch port forms its own collision domain, isolating traffic unless VLANs are set.
Reviewed how half-duplex links (like hubs or legacy NICs) still allow collisions, but only locally.
Broke down MAC address structure (OUI + Device ID), and learned how U/L and I/G bits define global vs local and unicast vs multicast addressing.
Understood locally administered MACs (example: 02:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E) and how to spot broadcast (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF).
Learned about fiber splicing—fusion (~0.3 dB loss) vs mechanical (~1 dB loss)—and how each splice affects signal strength.
Clarified that single-mode fiber uses laser diodes (narrow, long-distance beam) while multimode uses LEDs or VCSELs.
Explored EtherType values, where anything ≥ 0x0600 (1536) means “protocol type,” and anything lower means “payload length.”

Challenges Faced
Confusion over whether Ethernet referred to a physical cable or a protocol.
Unclear how MAC addresses relate to binary and hexadecimal notation.
Difficulty distinguishing multicast, broadcast, and universal MAC addresses.
Needed clarity on how half-duplex collisions happen only under specific conditions (hubs or legacy NICs).
Didn’t fully understand splicing in fiber optics or how loss per splice is calculated.
Mixed up EtherType vs frame length interpretation and where the 0x0600 cutoff comes from.

How I Solved Them
Used targeted prompts to isolate confusion points.
Asked: “What exactly is Ethernet—is it a cord or a protocol or what?” to clarify its layered nature.
Asked: “How do the 48 bits of a MAC match up to the 12 hexadecimal digits?” to bridge binary–hex understanding.
Asked: “What does group multicast mean compared to universal or OUI?” to grasp address categories.
Asked: “Half-duplex usually occurs if a hub is connected—why is this?” to connect old tech to collision domains.
Asked: “Explain a splice in fiber optics in simple English with analogies.” to visualize physical cable joining.
Asked: “How is the EtherType value used to distinguish between payload type and frame length?” to decode the 0x0600 rule.
Followed up with: “Explain how we got 80 and 1536.” to understand hexadecimal-to-decimal conversion.

Next Steps
Continue building and walking through my Mind Palace — the castle with four wings (Blue Keep, Green Hall, Red Tower, Yellow Spire).
Assign each CompTIA Network+ section to its proper “wing” and visualize details, color themes, and symbolic cues.
Review Ethernet frame fields and bit-level MAC structure within the “Infrastructure Hall.”
Add fiber splice types and diagrams to the “Service Tower.”
Revisit EtherType and MAC bit flags for deeper memorization.
Keep refining prompts to uncover subtle relationships between layers and technologies.
